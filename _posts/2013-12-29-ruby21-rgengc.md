title: "Ruby 2.1: RGenGC"
draft: true

Ruby 2.1 adds a "restricted" generational collector, with minor mark phases that dramatically reduce the cost of GC.

Let's take a look at the [evolution of Ruby's GC](/ruby21-rgengc/rgengc.png).

## Ruby 1.8: simple mark and sweep

<center>![](/ruby21-rgengc/ruby18.png)</center>

Classic mark and sweep implementation. The entire world is stopped during both phases.

1. Traverse object graph from roots and mark live objects,
   using a <span style="color:blue">bit</span> inside the object structure (FL_MARK).
2. Iterate over all heap slots and add unmarked slots to the freelist.

## Ruby 1.9.3: lazy sweep

<center>![](/ruby21-rgengc/ruby19.png)</center>

[@nari3][2] adds [LazySweepGC][3], reducing GC pauses to just the mark phase. The heap is swept incrementally as object slots are required.

## Ruby 2.0: bitmaps for COW-safety

<center>![](/ruby21-rgengc/ruby20.png)</center>

[@nari3][2] adds [Bitmap Marking GC][4], helping Unix systems [share memory across child processes][1]. The mark phase is also [rewritten to be non-recursive][7].

Although the memory savings from bitmaps were only modest, the patch freed up a bit (`FL_MARK` became `FL_WB_PROTECTED` later) and laid the groundwork for a generational collector.

## Ruby 2.1: oldgen and minor marking

<center>![](/ruby21-rgengc/ruby21.png)</center>

[@ko1][5] designs [RGenGC][6], a generational collector that can be implemented incrementally and supports C-extensions.

Objects on the heap are divided into two categories:

* protected by a write-barrier (`FL_WB_PROTECTED`)
* unprotected (or "shady")
  * missing write-barrier (`Proc`, `Ruby::Env`)
  * unsafe access from C-extension (`RARRAY_PTR`, `RSTRUCT_PTR`)

Only protected objects can be promoted to oldgen.

Unprotected objects cannot be promoted, but if referenced from oldgen they are added to a remembered set. Minor marks are much faster because they only have to traverse references from the remembered set.

### Heap Layout

Ruby objects live on the ruby heap, which is split up into pages. Each page is 16KB and holds ~408 object slots.

Every RVALUE slot on this page occupies 40 bytes. Strings [shorter than 23 bytes][7] and Arrays [with less than four elements][8] can be embedded directly within this 40 byte slot.

``` ruby
GC::INTERNAL_CONSTANTS[:HEAP_OBJ_LIMIT] #=> 408 slots per heap page
GC::INTERNAL_CONSTANTS[:RVALUE_SIZE]    #=>  40 bytes per object slot
```

Pages in the heap reside in one of two places: eden or tomb. Eden contains pages that have one or more live objects. The tomb contains empty pages with no objects. The sum of these pages represent the capacity of the ruby heap:

``` ruby
GC.stat(:heap_used) ==
  GC.stat(:heap_eden_page_length) + GC.stat(:heap_tomb_page_length)
```

During lazy sweep eden pages are swept one at a time. Each page provides up to 408 object slots for re-use. By the time the lazy sweep completes, all unmarked slots in eden have been replaced by new objects.

Empty pages found during the sweep are moved to the tomb. This reduces fragmentation in eden (by filling in sparse pages first), and allows the tomb to be grown or shrunk before it is used.

Once eden runs out of slots, the empty pages in tomb are moved back to eden to add space. Finally, when the tomb runs out of pages, a mark is triggered and the cycle begins anew.

### Major vs Minor GC

As an example, let's look at github.com's large rails app.

First, we'll measure how many long-lived objects are created after the app is booted:

``` ruby
# preload controllers/models and other code
GitHub.preload_all

# measure heap stats after a major mark and full sweep
GC.start # same as GC.start(full_mark: true, immediate_sweep: true)

# three ways to measure live slots
count = ObjectSpace.count_objects
count[:TOTAL] - count[:FREE]        #=> 565121

GC.stat(:heap_live_slot)            #=> 565121

GC.stat(:total_allocated_object) -
GC.stat(:total_freed_object)        #=> 565121
```

Of these ~565k long-lived bootup objects, ~95% are promoted to oldgen:

``` ruby
s = GC.stat
100.0 *              s[:old_object] / s[:heap_live_slot]  #=> 94.90
100.0 * s[:remembered_shady_object] / s[:heap_live_slot]  #=>  1.88
```

This means only ~5% of the heap needs to be traversed on minor marks, via references from the ~2% of objects that are remembered.

As expected, this makes minor GC pauses much *much* shorter: only 7ms in our app compared to 58ms for a major mark.

``` ruby
time{ GC.start(full_mark:  true, immediate_sweep: false) }  #=> 0.058
time{ GC.start(full_mark: false, immediate_sweep: false) }  #=> 0.007
```

The majority of mark phases during code execution will use a minor mark and finish very quickly. However, over time the size of oldgen and the remembered set can grow. If either of these double in size, a major mark is used to reset them.

The limits used to trigger a major mark can be monitored via GC.stat:

``` irb
>> GC.stat.values_at(:remembered_shady_object, :old_object)
=> [10647, 536785]

>> GC.stat.values_at(:remembered_shady_object_limit, :old_object_limit)
=> [21284, 1073030]
```

The frequency of major vs minor marks can also be monitored. For example, you might graph "major GCs per request", "minor GCs per request" or "minor GCs per major GC":

``` ruby
GC.stat(:count) == GC.stat(:minor_gc_count) + GC.stat(:major_gc_count)
```

### Tuning Variables

In our app above, we use the following GC settings:

``` bash
export RUBY_GC_HEAP_INIT_SLOTS=600000
export RUBY_GC_HEAP_FREE_SLOTS=600000
export RUBY_GC_HEAP_GROWTH_FACTOR=1.25
export RUBY_GC_HEAP_GROWTH_MAX_SLOTS=300000
```

* <b>`RUBY_GC_HEAP_INIT_SLOTS:` initial number of slots on the heap <tt>(def: 10000)</tt></b><br/>
  Our app boots with ~600k long-lived objects, so we use 600k here to reduce GC activity during boot.

* <b>`RUBY_GC_HEAP_FREE_SLOTS:` number of free slots to keep in reserve <tt>(def: 4096)</tt></b><br/>
  Our servers have extra RAM, so we bump this up to trade off memory for time between GCs.
  An average request allocates 75k objs, so 600k free slots gives us ~8 requests in between each mark phase.

* <b>`RUBY_GC_HEAP_GROWTH_FACTOR:` factor used to grow the heap <tt>(def: 1.8x)</tt></b><br>
  Since our heap is already quite big with the settings above, we reduce the growth factor (1.25x) to add slots in smaller increments.

* <b>`RUBY_GC_HEAP_GROWTH_MAX_SLOTS:` maximum new slots to add <tt>(def: no limit)</tt></b><br/>
  In addition to reducing the growth factor, we cap it so a maximum of 300k objects can be added to the heap at once.

### malloc() limits

Ruby objects occupy 40 bytes each, on pages in the eden heap. When an object needs more space, it will allocate memory using `ruby_xmalloc()`. For instance when a string outgrows 23 bytes, it allocates a separate (larger) buffer.

The additional memory used by an object can be measured with [ObjectSpace.memsize_of(o) in objspace.so][11].

Internally the VM keeps track of `malloc_increase`, the number of bytes that have been [allocated but not yet freed][10]. This is effectively the memory growth of the process. When more than 16MB is added, a GC is forced even if free slots are still available. The limit starts at 16MB, but adapts to the memory usage patterns in your code.

The initial/max values and dynamic growth factor can also be controlled via environment variables:

* <b>`RUBY_GC_MALLOC_LIMIT:` <tt>(default: 16MB)</tt></b>
* <b>`RUBY_GC_MALLOC_LIMIT_MAX:` <tt>(default: 32MB)</tt></b>
* <b>`RUBY_GC_MALLOC_LIMIT_GROWTH_FACTOR:` <tt>(default: 1.4x)</tt></b>


Similarly, the memory growth associated with oldgen is tracked separately in `oldmalloc_increase`. When this limit is tripped, a *major* GC is forced. These limits can be tuned as well:

* <b>`RUBY_GC_OLDMALLOC_LIMIT:` <tt>(default: 16MB)</tt></b>
* <b>`RUBY_GC_OLDMALLOC_LIMIT_MAX:` <tt>(default: 128MB)</tt></b>
* <b>`RUBY_GC_OLDMALLOC_LIMIT_GROWTH_FACTOR:` <tt>(default: 1.2x)</tt></b>


Both malloc increase and limit values can be monitored via GC.stat:

``` irb
>> GC.stat.values_at(:malloc_increase, :malloc_limit)
=> [14224, 64000000]

>> GC.stat.values_at(:oldmalloc_increase, :oldmalloc_limit)
=> [20464, 64000000]
```

In our app we've increased the initial limit to 64MB, to reduce GC activity during boot and when memory usage peaks.

``` bash
export RUBY_GC_MALLOC_LIMIT=64000000
export RUBY_GC_OLDMALLOC_LIMIT=64000000
```

### GC events

To continue the trend of improved visibility and monitoring, we're including GC tracepoints in 2.1. These are available from C, via `rb_tracepoint_new()`:

* `RUBY_INTERNAL_EVENT_GC_START`
* `RUBY_INTERNAL_EVENT_GC_END_MARK`
* `RUBY_INTERNAL_EVENT_GC_END_SWEEP`

C-extensions using these events can also take advantage of `rb_gc_stat()` and `rb_gc_latest_gc_info()`, which provide safe access to `GC.stat` and `GC.latest_gc_info`.

## Ruby 2.2 and beyond

With the introduction of RGenGC, Ruby 2.1 includes a significant upgrade to ruby's GC. A 95% oldgen promotion rate and 7ms minor mark are both remarkable achievements, especially considering not one of our C-extensions had to be modified. Hats off to [@ko1][5]!

Ruby 2.2 will expand the GC algorithm from two generations to three. (In fact, 2.1 already includes a `RGENGC_THREEGEN` compile flag to enable the third generation). @ko1 also plans to implement an [incremental mark phase][12], which would remove the need for long major GC pauses.
