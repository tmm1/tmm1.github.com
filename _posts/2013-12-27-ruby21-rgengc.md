title: "Ruby 2.1: RGenGC"
---

Ruby 2.1 adds a "restricted" generational collector, with minor mark phases that dramatically reduce the cost of GC.

Let's take a look at the [evolution of Ruby's GC](/ruby21-rgengc/rgengc.png):

### Ruby 1.8: simple mark and sweep

Classic mark and sweep implementation. The entire world is stopped during both phases.

1. Traverse object graph from roots and mark live objects,
   using a <span style="color:blue">bit</span> inside the object structure (FL_MARK).
2. Iterate over all heap slots and add unmarked slots to the freelist.

### Ruby 1.9.3: lazy sweep

[@nari3][2] adds [LazySweepGC][3], reducing GC pauses to just the mark phase. The heap is swept incrementally (one page at a time) as object slots are required.

(In 2.1, each heap page is 16KB and holds ~400 objects.)

### Ruby 2.0: bitmaps for COW-safety

[@nari3][2] adds [Bitmap Marking GC][4], helping Unix systems [share memory across child processes][1]. The mark phase is [rewritten to be non-recursive][7].

Although the memory savings from bitmaps were only modest, the patch freed up a bit (`FL_MARK` became `FL_WB_PROTECTED` later) and laid the groundwork for a generational collector.

### Ruby 2.1: oldgen and minor marking

[@ko1][5] designs [RGenGC][6], a generational collector that can be implemented incrementally and supports C-extensions.

Objects on the heap are divided into two categories:

* protected by a write-barrier (`FL_WB_PROTECTED`)
* unprotected (or "shady")
  * missing write-barrier (`Proc`, `Ruby::Env`)
  * unsafe access from C-extension (`RARRAY_PTR`, `RSTRUCT_PTR`)

Only protected objects can be promoted to oldgen.

Unprotected objects cannot be promoted, but if referenced from oldgen they are added to a remembered set. Minor marks are much faster because they only have to traverse references from the remembered set.
