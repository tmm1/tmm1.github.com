title: "Ruby 2.1: Out-of-Band GC"
tagline: 'avoid GC pauses during requests with OOBGC'
draft: true
---

Ruby 2.1's [GC is better than ever][4], but ruby still uses a stop-the-world GC implementation. This means collections triggered during request processing will add latency to your response time. One way to mitigate this is by running GC in-between requests, i.e. "Out-of-Band".

OOBGC is a popular technique, first introduced by [Unicorn][1] and later integrated into [Passenger][2]. Traditionally, these out-of-band collectors force a GC every N requests. While this works well, it requires careful tuning and can add CPU pressure if unnecessary collections occur too often.

In [kiji (twitter's REE fork)][5] @evanweaver introduced [`GC.preemptive_start`][3] as an alternative to the `every N request` model. This new method could make more intelligent decisions about OOBGC based on the size of the heap and the number of free slots. We've long used a similar trick in our 1.9.3 fork to optimize OOBGC on github.com.

When we upgraded to a [patched ruby 2.1][6] in production earlier this month, I translated these techniques into a [new OOBGC for ruby 2.1][7]. Powered by RGenGC's new tracepoint hooks, it understands lazy vs immediate sweeping and minor/major GC to make the best descision about when garbage collection is required. Using the new OOBGC is very simple:

``` ruby
require 'gctools/oobgc'
GC::OOB.run() # run this after every request body is flushed
```

### OOBGC results

With ruby 2.1, our average OOBGC pause time (<font color="blue">`oobgc.mean`</font>) went from 125ms to 50ms thanks to [RGenGC][4]. The number of out-of-band collections (<font color="firebrick">`oobgc.count`</font>) also went down, since the new OOBGC only runs when necessary.

The overall result is much less CPU time (<font color="purple">`oobgc.sum`</font>) spent doing GC work between requests.

### GC during requests

![](http://cl.ly/image/0G2P2l0N1z0J/graph.png)

After the upgrade, we're performing GC during requests 2-3x more often than before (<font color="firebrick">`gc.time.count`</font>). However since all major collections can happen preemptively, only minor GCs happen during requests making the average GC pause only 25ms (<font color="blue">`gc.time.mean`</font>).

Again, the overall result is less GC overhead in-request (<font color="purple">`gc.time.sum`</font>), even though GC happens more often.
